            This list is just a list of strings, so the application has to match these strings up
            with tag objects in the system.  Also, some tags may exist, some may not, so it is up
            to the application to determine this and treat each tag appropriately.

            <remarks>
            This endpoint only updates the properties directly on the food truck.  To
            change elements on 'child' objects of the food truck (tags, social media accounts,
            reviews, schedules), you need to look in the appropriate association controller, 
            for example FoodTruckTagsController.
            <para>
            This decision was made because when editing a food truck, I think it is more likely
            someone will just want to edit elements like the name or description.  It seemed 
            unnatural to make them also include the tags or social media accounts as part of
            the same update operation.

            This code is split out into a helper method to keep the ConfigureServices method from getting too large.
            Having a separate helper method helps to keep each helper tightly focused on one job as well.
